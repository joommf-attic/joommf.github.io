## I have a query on some aspect of using the JOOMMF project

Create an *issue* at [https://github.com/joommf/help](https://github.com/joommf/help).

We use this as the central point for queries relating to the Python
interface to OOMMF, OOMMFC, and in later stages of the project to the
Jupyter Notebook integration and data analysis.
