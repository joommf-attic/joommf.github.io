# I have a query on some aspect of using the JOOMMF project

## Option 1: Use Github issues

Our preferred way of recording questions, issues and bug requests is via Github issues: Create an *issue* at [https://github.com/joommf/help](https://github.com/joommf/help).

We use this as the central point for queries relating to the Python
interface to OOMMF, OOMMFC, and in later stages of the project to the
Jupyter Notebook integration and data analysis.


(You need a github account for this.)

## Option 2: Use our mailing list

Alternatively, join the google group [joommf-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/joommf-users).
