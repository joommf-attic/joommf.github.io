## JOOMMF workshop at Intermag2017, Dublin

In this workshop we provide a brief introduction to
computational micromagnetics. We introduce and teach the use of a
Python interface [1] to drive the OOMMF simulation package. At the
beginning of the workshop, we provide a lecture style introduction,
which is followed by practical exercises where attendees will have an
opportunity to carry out small micromagnetic calculations, modify
given examples and ask more specific questions. All participants are
expected to bring their laptops. This project is a part of the
Jupyter-OOMMF (JOOMMF) activity in the OpenDreamKit [2] project and we
acknowledge financial support from Horizon 2020 European Research
Infrastructures project (#676541). The work is also supported by the
EPSRC CDT in Next Generation Computational Modelling EP/L015382/1, and
the EPSRC grants EP/M022668/1 and EP/N032128/1.

Time and place: to be confirmed soon

We ask participants to register attendance in advance (by emailing
jupyteroommf@gmail.com) so that installations instructions can be
shared before the event, and attendees can arrive with the relevant
software pre-installed as much as possible. Places are allocated on a
first come first serve basis.
