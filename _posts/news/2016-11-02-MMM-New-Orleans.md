## The OOMMF Calculator (Python interface to OOMMF)

An important step towards micromagnetic calculations within the
[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org) is the provision of a Python
interface that allows to drive the OOMMF simulation software.

During the 61 Magnetism and Magnetic Materials conference, the first
prototype of this Python interface is presented in the Micromagnetics
session (*CF-03. Python interface for OOMMF*) at 8:54 on Wednesday 2
November 2016 in New Orleans.

Here are the [slides (pdf)](assets/2016-11-02-MMM2016-CF-03-Python-OOMMF.pdf).
