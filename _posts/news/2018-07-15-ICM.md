## JOOMMF workshop at ICM2018, San Francisco, USA

In this workshop we will provide a brief introduction to computational
micromagnetics. We will introduce and teach the use of a Python
interface (https://joommf.github.io) to drive the OOMMF simulation package. At
the beginning of the workshop, we will provide a lecture style
introduction, which is followed by practical exercises where attendees
will have an opportunity to carry out small micromagnetic
calculations, modify given examples and ask more specific
questions. All participants are expected to bring their laptops. This
project is a part of the Jupyter-OOMMF (JOOMMF) activity in the
OpenDreamKit [2] project and we acknowledge financial support from
Horizon 2020 European Research Infrastructures project (#676541). The
work is also supported by the EPSRC CDT in Next Generation
Computational Modelling EP/L015382/1, and the EPSRC grants
EP/M022668/1 and EP/N032128/1.

Time and place: Sunday 15 July 2018 13:30, Room 105 at the Moscone Center
