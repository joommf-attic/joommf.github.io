Marijan Beg and Ryan A. Pepper

In this workshop we will provide a brief introduction to computational
micromagnetics. We will introduce and teach the use of a Python
interface (https://joommf.github.io) to drive the OOMMF simulation
package. At the beginning of the workshop, we will provide a lecture
style introduction, which is followed by practical exercises where
attendees will have an opportunity to carry out small micromagnetic
calculations, modify given examples and ask more specific
questions. All participants are expected to bring their
laptops. Registration for the workhop can be done during the
[registration](http://www.icm2018sf.org/?p=register) for the
conference. This project is a part of the Jupyter-OOMMF (JOOMMF)
activity in the OpenDreamKit [2] project and we acknowledge financial
support from Horizon 2020 European Research Infrastructures project
(#676541). The work is also supported by the EPSRC CDT in Next
Generation Computational Modelling EP/L015382/1, and the EPSRC grants
EP/M022668/1 and EP/N032128/1.

Time and place: Sunday 15 July 2018 13.30-17.00, Room 105 at the Moscone Center
