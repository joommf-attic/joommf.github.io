## JOOMMF project starting

As part of the [OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org) project, the
Southampton partner site is leading the development of a computational
environment in the area of micromagnetic modelling.

We will design a [virtual research
environment](http://www.2020-horizon.com/e-Infrastructures-for-virtual-research-environments-%28VRE%29-i1490.html)
that combines scriptable and reproducible workflows of simulation,
exploration and data analysis with graphical elements, and which can
be used locally or executed remotely in the cloud or remote machines.

Dr [Marijan Beg](http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/mb1a15/) has been recruited to work on this project, with
contributions from [Ryan Pepper](http://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/rp20g15/) and leadership from [Hans Fangohr](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~fangohr) (at
Southampton).

All code is open source and available at [https://github.com/joommf](https://github.com/joommf).

The project name JOOMMF derives from the combination of the widely
used [Object Oriented MicroMagnetic
Framework](http://math.nist.gov/oommf/) with the [Jupyter
Notebook](http://jupyter), i.e. Jupyter-OOMMF -> JOOMMF.
