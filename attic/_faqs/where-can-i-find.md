## Where is the code?

At [https://github.com/joommf](https://github.com/joommf)

Currently (late 2016), the most interesting package for users is [http://github.com/joommf/oommfc](http://github.com/joommf/oommfc).

## Where is the documentation?

The documentation of OOMMFC is available at [http://oommfc.readthedocs.io/en/latest](http://oommfc.readthedocs.io/en/latest).


## Have you got a mailing list?

We have two: we use [joommf-news]() to announce new releases (low frequency).

We offer [joommf-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/joommf-users) for discussions.

For support queries, we prefer Github issues submitted from [https://github.com/joommf/help](https://github.com/joommf/help).
